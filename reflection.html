The second quarter really cemented my knowledge and mastery of CSS. CSS is Cascading Style Sheets and enables us to style a document created in HTML. There are multiple ways to apply CSS to an HTML document, such as inline, internal and linked styles. Knowing what CSS could do relative to HTML helped me better understand alignments, padding, margin, color, font families, etc. It made me realize how crucial this styling effort was across the board for a more professional and cohesive appearance. <br> <br>
I'm like a web developer now with CSS superpowers! Much of what I've learned this quarter comes from all things CSS related: CSS properties, elements and selectors, and block and inline elements. The notion that CSS properties dictate how an element renders itself—what font size or color, if there is a border, margin, background, etc.—made me more conscious of how a site renders. For example, learning about block-level elements—div, p—and inline elements—span, a—and that they exist in the flow of a document render helped me acknowledge that they too fall within line when I render them. Similarly, learning about selectors—universal, class, and ID—and that they create parameters just as strong without redundancy now allows me to understand how to render CSS for all three types of elements, but class and ID now allow me to simplify my coding. <br> <br>
These skills translate to real life when creating one's own or a business website and modifying it to suit one's branding requirements. For instance, a portfolio website I've created, and using CSS properties to change colors and fonts, I could use CSS to showcase certain aspects of my work through those changes. I'd use block and inline elements to correctly change sizing for the hierarchical importance of my projects, and I'd use selectors to ensure consistency across the various pages. Speaking of consistency, CSS has taught me that every little detail matters, which is applicable to any real-life project requiring dedication and focus. </td> </tr> </table>
